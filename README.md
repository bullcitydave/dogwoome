####Assignment
Homework project for The Iron Yard Front End Engineering Boot Camp in Durham, NC.  Gist: to build a turn-based "monster mash" game. But why be so violent? Instead of attacking monsters, the players are dogs at the shelter, and their goal is to kill any doubts of would-be adopters. They'll need licks, cuddles, and even their barks to woo over the humans.

==================

I only worked on this for a few days, so there are plenty of more functional and code enhancements I would have loved to have made.

Code
* Use more prototype information in the game
* Build more complex logic/algorithms (it is extremely simple at present, where the only variable between plays are a few human properties)
* Tighten code (JS/CSS); eliminate redunancy in functions

Functionality/UX
* Track total clicks
* Responsive design - this has been built for 800px width
* Multiplayer (dogs)
* Multiple adopters (humans) in each game
* Again, more complexity
